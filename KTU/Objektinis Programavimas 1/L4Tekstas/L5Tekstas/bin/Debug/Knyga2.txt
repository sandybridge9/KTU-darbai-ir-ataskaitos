Initialize queue to null, which is really just a compiler trick that says "I'll figure out my own uninitialized variables, thank you very much".
It's a useful trick, but I don't like it in this case - you have too many if branches to easily check that you're doing it properly.
If you really wanted to do it this way, something like this would be clearer Galima įterpti tik minimalų būtiną tarpų skaičių.
